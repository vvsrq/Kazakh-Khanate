Formation of the Kazakh Khanate and its founders - Zhanibek and Kerey

The formation of Kazakh statehood began in the XV century, when, against the background of the collapse of the Golden Horde and the Uzbek Khanate, leaders who disagreed with the policy of Abulkhair Khan appeared. These leaders, Sultans Zhanibek and Kerey, became the founders of the Kazakh Khanate. Their efforts led to the creation of an independent state, which was an important step in the formation of the Kazakh nation and state.

Prerequisites for the formation of the Kazakh Khanate

The formation of the Kazakh Khanate was caused by several important historical factors. First, the disintegration of the Golden Horde and the Uzbek Khanate in the 15th century created a power vacuum in which independent tribes that sought self-determination were strengthened. The political situation in these states was tense, which led to numerous feuds. In the conditions of such unstable processes and there was a desire to create a new state.

Who were the founders of the Kazakh Khanate?

The founders of the Kazakh Khanate were Sultans Kerey and Zhanibek. They were two prominent figures who strayed from Abulkhair Khan, the ruler of the Uzbek Khanate, in 1465 in search of a better life for their subjects. They found support in Mogolistan, where the ruler Esen Buga gave them refuge.

These two sultans became the figures around whom the disparate Kazakh tribes united. It was their activity that served as the basis for the creation of an independent state - the Kazakh Khanate.

Formation of the Kazakh nation

Kerey and Zhanibek not only created a new state, but also laid the foundations for the formation of a new ethnos. People who joined their army began to call themselves “Kazakhs”, which means “free people”. This name came to symbolize their independence and their desire for freedom from the political control that existed in the Uzbek Khanate. These tribes gradually became the basis of the Kazakh nation.

When and how was the Kazakh Khanate formed?

The year 1465 is the officially recognized time of the formation of the Kazakh Khanate, when Kerey and Zhanibek, having separated from the Uzbek Khanate, created their own political unit in Mogolistan. According to historical data, it was during this period that the legal and political consolidation of the Kazakh lands began. Under the leadership of these two khans, a new system of government was being formed, with courts, tax system and traditions, which became the basis for the further development of the khanate.

Politics and struggle for independence

After the death of Abulkhair Khan in 1468, the Kazakh khanate began to actively expand. Nomadic territories increased, and the statehood itself strengthened. An important event was the struggle of the Kazakh khans with Abulkhair Khan's son, Shaykh-Khaydar, who died in 1471. This allowed the Kazakh khanate to significantly expand its territories.

After Kerey's death in 1473, his son Burunduk became the ruler of Eastern Desht-i-Kipchak. Zhanibek also played an important role in the formation of the Kazakh khanate, dealing with the internal affairs of the state, the development of trade and the creation of the army. His death in 1480 left the Kazakh khanate in the hands of his son Kasym, who was able to significantly expand the territory of the khanate.

Conclusion

The question of the exact date of the formation of the Kazakh Khanate is still a matter of debate among scholars, but it is officially believed that the Kazakh Khanate was founded in 1465. In this year, Kerey and Zhanibek, who had nomadized from the Uzbek Khanate, began to form an independent state. Today, their contribution to the creation of Kazakh statehood and ethnicity is invaluable, and their memory is preserved in monuments and historical documents.
