Annexation by the Russian Empire

The annexation of the Kazakh Khanate by the Russian Empire was a gradual and complex process that spanned the 18th and 19th centuries. Marking the end of the Kazakh Khanate’s sovereignty, this period witnessed significant changes in Kazakh political structure, land use, and cultural life. The process was driven by a combination of internal challenges within the Kazakh state, Russian expansionist policies, and growing economic interests in Central Asia.

Early Relations and Russian Expansion

The relationship between the Kazakh tribes and the Russian Empire initially began through trade and mutual cooperation in the early 18th century. Following the devastating Jungar invasions, some Kazakh leaders saw an alliance with Russia as a way to protect their people from external threats. In 1731, Abulkhair Khan of the Small Zhuz sought Russian protection, leading to the formal signing of a treaty that made the Small Zhuz a protectorate of the Russian Empire. Over time, this relationship expanded to include the Middle and Great Zhuzes, although the Kazakh people retained relative autonomy in the early stages.

Gradual Loss of Autonomy

While the early agreements with Russia allowed the Kazakh khans a degree of self-governance, Russian control over Kazakh lands gradually increased. Throughout the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Russian forts and settlements were established across the Kazakh steppe, often without the consent of local Kazakh leaders. These fortifications, such as those along the Irtysh River, helped Russia solidify its military presence and expand its control over Kazakh territory.

In 1822, the Russian government implemented the Statute on the Siberian Kirghiz, which effectively abolished the khanate system in the Middle Zhuz, replacing it with Russian administrative structures. This policy was followed in the Small Zhuz in 1824, further eroding Kazakh autonomy. The Great Zhuz, being geographically further from Russian influence, maintained partial independence until the 1840s, when Russian forces extended their control into southern Kazakhstan.

Kazakh Resistance to Russian Rule

The annexation process faced significant resistance from Kazakh leaders and people, who opposed the loss of their traditional way of life and the encroachment on their lands. Key figures like Kenesary Kasymov, who led a major uprising in the 1840s, became symbols of resistance. Kenesary, the last khan of the Kazakhs, attempted to unite the Kazakh tribes in an effort to resist Russian control and restore the independence of the Kazakh Khanate. His revolt, although ultimately unsuccessful, highlighted the strong desire among the Kazakh people to preserve their sovereignty.

Changes in Kazakh Society and Land Use

With the completion of annexation in the 19th century, Russian authorities introduced policies that transformed Kazakh society. Traditional nomadic practices were disrupted as Russian settlers began to occupy fertile Kazakh lands, and new agricultural settlements altered the landscape of the steppe. Russian administrators imposed taxation and restricted traditional grazing routes, challenging the Kazakhs' nomadic lifestyle and economy. This shift led to economic hardship and loss of cultural autonomy for the Kazakh people.

Legacy of Annexation

The annexation of the Kazakh Khanate by the Russian Empire left a lasting legacy on Kazakhstan’s history. The loss of independence marked a significant transformation in Kazakh society, leading to profound changes in social structure, economy, and culture. However, the Kazakh people retained their cultural identity and continued to value their heritage and traditions.

Despite the challenges brought by annexation, Kazakh resistance movements and cultural preservation efforts persisted, influencing future generations and inspiring efforts toward national revival. The memory of this period continues to shape Kazakhstan’s historical consciousness, symbolizing both the struggle for sovereignty and the resilience of Kazakh identity
