            <p>Founder of the Kazakh Khanate, Kerey Khan united the Kazakh tribes and established the foundations of the Khanate.</p>
            <button class="toggle-info">More Info</button>
            <div class="khan-info">
                <p>Kerey Khan (1425-1474) was one of the founders of the Kazakh Khanate and its first khan, ruling from 1465 to 1474, together with Zhanibek Khan. He was a descendant of Urus Khan and belonged to the Chingizid family. In 1465, after a conflict with Abu-l-Khair, the Shibanid Khan, Kerey and Zhanibek together with 200 thousand nomads migrated to Mogulistan, where they founded their own state, which became the basis of the Kazakh Khanate.</p>
                <p>Kerey and Zhanibek were important political figures of the time, and although Kerey was considered Khan, the actual power was in the hands of Zhanibek. They actively fought for independence from the Shibanids, and their actions led to a significant strengthening of the Kazakh position in Eastern Desht-i-Kipchak, including the capture of key cities such as Suzak, Sauran and Turkestan.</p>
                <p>After Abu-l-Khair's death in 1468, the Kazakhs continued their struggle against the Shibanids and became more active in seizing territory. In 1471, after a series of battles, Sheikh-Khaydar-Khan died, and Kerey himself died in 1474. His son Burunduk became khan, but the rule continued with the participation of Zhanibek and his descendants.</p>
                <p>Kerey Khan left a significant legacy, and his memory is commemorated by monuments, including a monument in Astana that was unveiled in 2010 in honor of the founders of the Kazakh Khanate.</p>

            <button class="toggle-info">More Info</button>
            <div class="khan-info">
                <p>Janibek Khan (c. 1428 - c. 1480) was the second khan of the Kazakh Khanate and one of its founders, ruling from 1473 to 1480. He was the son of Barak Khan, a descendant of Urus Khan and Genghis Khan. In 1465, after a rebellion against the Uzbek khan Abul-Khair-khan, Janibek, together with Kerey, migrated to Mogulistan, where he founded a new state, which became the core of the Kazakh Khanate.</p>
                <p>Janibek Khan played a key role in the political and military strengthening of the Kazakh Khanate. For his wisdom he received the title “Az” (wise), and thanks to this he was recognized not only by his own people, but also by neighboring khanates. Despite numerous internal and external challenges, he was able to strengthen the independence of the Kazakh Khanate and expand its territory, including important cities such as Signak.</p>
                <p>Dzhanibek was also known for his dynastic policy - he had nine sons, including the future khan Kasim, who succeeded him after his death. Janibek also had several daughters who played an important role in inter-dynastic alliances.</p>
                <p>After his death in 1480, the Kazakh Khanate continued to struggle for its independence, but the successes of Dzhanibek's rule became an important foundation for the further development of the state. His legacy has remained in history as an example of wise rule and steadfastness in the struggle for independence.</p>

            <h2>Burynduk Khan (1474/1480 – 1511)</h2>
            <p>Burynduk Khan, son of Kerei Khan, ruled the Kazakh Khanate from the late 15th century until 1511. Though he initially led the Khanate, his influence waned as the power of Kasym Khan grew.</p>
            <button class="toggle-info">More Info</button>
            <div class="khan-info">
                <p>Burynduk Khan, born in 1430, was the son of Kerei Khan, one of the founders of the Kazakh Khanate. He became the khan around 1474 and maintained his position until 1511. During his reign, he faced internal power struggles, particularly with Kasym Sultan, son of Janibek Khan, whose growing military influence and victories against external threats overshadowed Burynduk’s authority. This led to a shift in loyalty among the Kazakh nobles, who increasingly supported Kasym.</p>
                <p>Burynduk’s reign involved significant battles, including conflicts with the Shaybanids and the Nogai Horde. He successfully resisted Shaybanid incursions, notably capturing Sygnaq after a protracted siege. However, his 1472 campaign against the Nogai Horde was unsuccessful. The early 16th century saw Burynduk’s weakening position, and eventually, in 1511, Kasym Khan ascended, allowing Burynduk to retire to Samarkand, where he lived until his death.</p>
                <p>Burynduk Khan’s legacy is also tied to his family. He had four sons and several daughters, one of whom married the influential Shaybanid ruler Muhammad Shaybani, strengthening diplomatic ties. His daughter Mihr Sultan Khanum became a notable patron of the arts and sciences in Samarkand, where Burynduk eventually sought refuge.</p>
                <p>Burynduk Khan was portrayed in the 2022 film "Rassvet Velikoi Stepi," which explored his role in the Kazakh Khanate's history. His reign highlights the complexities of Kazakh political and military dynamics during its formative years.</p>

            <div class="khan-info">
                <p>Kasym Khan (c. 1445 - 1521) ruled the Kazakh Khanate from 1511 to 1521, becoming one of its most powerful rulers. He was the son of Zhanibek Khan and played a crucial role in consolidating power after the turmoil that followed the fall of the previous ruler, Burunduk Khan.</p>
                <p>Kasym Khan significantly expanded the Kazakh territories, particularly in the South and East. He led successful military campaigns against the Shaybanids and strengthened Kazakh control over key regions like Sayram, which were vital for trade and political influence.</p>
                <p>In addition to his military successes, Kasym Khan worked on diplomatic relations, forming alliances with neighboring states like Moghulistan. His reign marked a period of relative stability and territorial expansion for the Kazakh Khanate.</p>
                <p>Kasym Khan also established the *Kasym Khudaydar* code, which is believed to be one of the earliest legal frameworks for the Kazakh people. He was highly respected for his strategic vision and diplomatic skill, which helped the Kazakh Khanate gain international recognition.</p>
                <p>After his death in 1521, the Kazakh Khanate faced internal struggles, but the foundation Kasym laid allowed his successors to continue building the state's power. His legacy as a great leader is still remembered in Kazakh history.</p>

                <p>Mamash Khan was the elder son of Kasym Khan, the ruler of the Kazakh Khanate. He ascended to the throne after his father's death in 1521. Despite his leadership, the Kazakh Khanate faced internal conflicts as different factions vied for power.</p>
                <p>One of the most significant challenges during Mamash's reign was the territorial loss to the Nogai Horde, which captured lands up to the Turgai River. His inability to defend these territories led to a decrease in the Kazakh Khanate's power.</p>
                <p>However, despite military setbacks, Mamash Khan managed to maintain some level of diplomatic relations, with Russian tsars acknowledging his authority. Ivan the Terrible sent ambassadors to Mamash Khan during his reign.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, Mamash's reign was short-lived, and he died in 1523 during an internal struggle for power. He was succeeded by his cousin, Tahir Khan.

He came to power in 1523 following the death of Mamash Khan. However, his reign was largely unsuccessful due to his inability to unite the steppe nobility and his lack of leadership qualities.</p>
                <p>His rule was characterized by military defeats against the Mangyts and Shaybanids, as well as internal conflicts within the Kazakh Khanate. Despite some successes, such as defending Zhetysu from Oirat and Mughal raids, his leadership was undermined by his cruelty and lack of strategic vision.</p>
                <p>Tahir Khan's reign witnessed the loss of significant territories, including the defeat in the Kazakh-Nogai War, which resulted in the occupation of lands up to the Turgai River. His brutal policies led to a growing discontent among his people, and he was eventually abandoned by many of his followers.</p>
                <p>His rule ended in 1533, when he died in a state of despair among the Kyrgyz. His death led to the succession of his brother, Buidash Khan. Tahir Khan is remembered as a figure whose reign marked a period of instability and decline for the Kazakh Khanate.</p>

                <p>In 1537, Togum Khan and his forces were defeated in the Battle of San-Tash, a key event in the struggle between the Kazakhs and the Mughals. Togum Khan, along with 37 sultans, including his sons, perished in this battle, leading to a severe weakening of Kazakh power.</p>
                <p>The defeat was so devastating that it resulted in the loss of all the Syr Darya cities, and the Kazakh nomads were left with only their territories around the lower reaches of the Syr Darya River and northeast of the Aral Sea. Togum Khan's death marked a significant moment in the decline of the Kazakh Khanate.</p>
                <p>There have been various interpretations of the event, with some historians suggesting the battle was fought against the Chagatai Khanate, while others believe it was a conflict with the Mughals.

Gubin reported tensions along the western borders of the Kazakh Khanate with Nogai forces, who were pushing against the Kazakh territories.</p>
                <p>In these years, the Kazakh khans managed to repel the Nogai advances, pushing them back beyond the Emba River. However, this was only a temporary success. The Nogai Horde, led by their rulers, continued to expand their territory into the western reaches of the Kazakh Khanate.</p>
                <p>Despite the pressure from the Nogais, the Kazakh Khanate remained a significant power in the region. In September 1536, Gubin reported that the Kazakh forces were still considered very strong, with victories over the Tashkent forces. However, Akhmat Khan was ultimately killed in battle in 1536 during a conflict with the Nogai forces led by Seydak. His death led to a brief succession crisis and the rise of Azis Sultan as his successor.</p>

                <p>After the death of his brother Tауekel Khan, Esim Khan ascended to the throne during a military campaign in Bukhara. He is known for his military prowess and successfully repelled external threats, particularly from the Oirat (Kalmyks) and the Uzbek Khanate. His rule saw the consolidation of Kazakh territories, including the annexation of several important cities like Samarkand and the cities of the Ferghana Valley.</p>
                <p>Esim Khan also played a key role in the political dynamics of Central Asia, engaging in alliances and military campaigns to protect Kazakh sovereignty. He established reforms to limit the power of the ruling elite and promoted a more decentralized governance system, ultimately reducing the influence of the traditional nobility. His reforms were codified in the "Esim Khan's Old Path," a legal document that outlined the rights and responsibilities of the Khan, the beys (tribal leaders), and the people.</p>
                <p>Esim Khan is remembered for his diplomatic skills, his efforts to unite the Kazakh people, and his success in repelling foreign invasions. He passed away in 1628, and his son Janibek succeeded him as Khan of the Kazakh Khanate.</p>

            <h2>Jangir Khan (1643—1652)</h2>
            <p>Jangir Khan, also known as Salqam Jangir Khan, was a Kazakh Khan who ruled the Kazakh Khanate from 1643 to 1652. He was the son of Esim Khan and was known for his leadership and military prowess.</p>
            <button class="toggle-info">More Info</button>
            <div class="khan-info">
                <p>Jangir Khan earned the nickname "Salqam Jangir," meaning "Impressive Jangir," due to his small stature but strong build, as well as his impressive victory at the Orbulak Battle. He was a prominent state figure and military leader, known for his determination, resilience, and willingness to sacrifice for his people. These traits placed him on par with his father, Esim Khan, and helped save the Kazakh Khanate from internal conflicts and external threats.</p>
                <p>Under Jangir's rule, the Kazakh Khanate faced threats from the Dzungar Khanate, led by Batür Khun Tai Ji, who created a powerful centralized state in Dzungaria. During this period, internal strife plagued the Kazakh Khanate, with various Genghisid descendants vying for the throne. This constant political struggle hindered Jangir's authority as Khan.</p>
                <p>In 1635, Jangir was captured by the Dzungars during a battle. After a peace agreement, he was released with the promise not to disturb the Dzungar borders. His captivity temporarily weakened his authority among his political rivals and the people.</p>
                <p>Jangir maintained diplomatic and allied relations with the Kashgar Khanate, continuing his father’s political traditions. His son, Appak Sultan, served as an ambassador to the Mughal Khan Abdallah between 1638–1652. Another son, Tauke Khan, played an active role in foreign policy, visiting Kashgar in 1640. Jangir also had friendly relations with the Uzbek ruler Yalangtush Bahadur of Samarkand, forming alliances in response to the coalition formed by Erdeni-Batur to attack Semirechye.</p>
                <p>In 1643, when Erdeni-Batur seized lands in the southern and southeastern foothills of the Tian Shan, Jangir chose to confront him despite the numerical superiority of the Dzungar forces. The famous Orbulak Battle occurred near the Or River in the Dzungar Alatau mountains. Jangir employed trench warfare tactics, positioning part of his forces in a ravine between two mountains and fortifying it with a high earthen wall. This surprise tactic resulted in a significant victory, with the Dzungars suffering heavy losses (around 10,000 men) and retreating. When reinforcements from Samarkand, led by Yalangtush Bahadur, arrived, the Dzungars withdrew from the battle.</p>
                <p>Despite this victory, the wars with the Dzungars continued, with shifting successes. The Dzungars briefly controlled parts of Eastern Semirechye.</p>
                <p>In 1652, during a campaign by the Khoshut Khan Ochirto-Cecen Khan in the Kazakh territories, Jangir Khan was killed by the son of Ochirto-Cecen Khan, Galdama Noyon. He was buried in Turkestan near the mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasavi, and later a mausoleum was built over his grave, which no longer survives.</p>

            <p>Batyr Khan was a Kazakh Khan who ruled the Kazakh Khanate from 1652 to 1680. He was the son of Bolkey Sultan and succeeded Jangir Khan to the throne.</p>
            <button class="toggle-info">More Info</button>
            <div class="khan-info">
                <p>Batyr Khan ascended to the throne in 1652 following the death of his nephew, Jangir Khan. According to Chokan Valikhanov, Batyr Khan was the son of Bolkey Sultan, the son of Uzek, who was the son of Janibek Khan. Batyr Khan's reign is recorded as being part of the Topen state, which was mentioned during a visit to Altun Khan in 1617, when he was already a ruler under Esim Khan. This suggests that Batyr Khan was a distant cousin of Esim Khan.</p>
                <p>Chokan Valikhanov's genealogy table indicated that Batyr Khan was the son of Bolkey Sultan and the father of Ayshuak (an ancestor of Abulkhair). However, there are some inconsistencies with other sources, where Batyr Khan does not appear in the genealogy of Abulkhair. Some Kazakh historians believe that Abulkhair may have had a less distinguished lineage, and if Batyr Khan were his ancestor, such claims might be refuted. It is likely that Batyr Khan was indeed the son of Bolkey Sultan but the brother, not the father, of Ayshuak, suggesting a potential error in Valikhanov's records.</p>
                <p>Batyr Khan ruled during a tumultuous period, facing internal and external challenges. His reign saw efforts to stabilize the Kazakh Khanate amidst territorial disputes and conflicts. He passed away in 1680 in Turkestan.</p>

            <p>Tauke Khan was a prominent Kazakh Khan who ruled from 1680 to 1715. Born into the Torai dynasty, he was the son of Salkam Zhanger Khan and Banу-Khanum. His reign is often referred to as the "Golden Age" of the Kazakh Khanate, marked by significant internal reforms and victories in battles against external threats, particularly the Dzungar Khanate.</p>

            <div class="khan-info">
                <p>During his early years, Tauke was involved in diplomacy, even serving as a representative in the court of Kashgar. By the age of 17, he became the Khan of the Younger Juz. His strategic foresight helped consolidate the various Kazakh tribes, overcoming internal conflicts and strengthening the Khanate’s power.</p>
                <p>Tauke's reign was challenged by several external threats, notably the invasions by the Dzungars. Despite suffering from their aggressive campaigns, he successfully led multiple military campaigns to defend the Kazakh lands. In 1681, the Dzungar forces crossed the Chu River, leading to several years of clashes, which culminated in Tauke's son being captured and imprisoned for 14 years.</p>
                <p>Under Tauke’s rule, a significant legal reform was implemented with the creation of the "Zheti Zhargy" (Seven Laws), which became a cornerstone of Kazakh law. Tauke established a strong advisory council with prominent figures such as Tole Bi, Kazybek Bi, and Aiteke Bi, helping to centralize governance and strengthen his rule. His reign ended in 1718, after which the Kazakh Khanate saw the rise of separate Khanates within the three Juzes.</p>

His reign followed that of Tauke Khan, and he was succeeded by Bolat Khan. He was also involved in significant historical events, such as the Bashkir Uprising (1704–1711), the Kazakh-Jungar Wars, and the Battle of Ayaguz.</p>

            <div class="khan-info">
                <p>During his reign, Kayyp Khan faced difficult times, especially with the ongoing war against the Jungar Khanate. In 1716, the main Jungar army launched an invasion from the Ili River toward Ayaguz. Meanwhile, other Jungar troops captured territories between the Biya and Katun rivers.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1718, a three-day battle occurred at the Ayaguz River between the Kazakh militia and the Jungar army. Despite initial successes by the Kazakh forces in the first two days, the battle ended in a decisive Jungar victory. Kayyp Khan fled the battlefield but was killed shortly afterward in his camp. According to Russian ambassador Bryancev, the battle was brutal, and the Kazakh defeat was primarily due to the disorganization between Sultan Abulkhair and Kayyp Khan, who were rivals. Additionally, the Jungars launched a surprise attack from the rear.</p>
                <p>In 1718, the Jungar forces also defeated other Kazakh militias on the Arys River, further weakening the Kazakh Khanate.</p>
                
                <p>In foreign relations, from October 1716 to September 1717, a diplomatic mission from Siberia, known as the Belousov Embassy, visited the Kazakh capital. It brought news of a decree from Siberian Governor Prince M.P. Gagarin regarding his protection of Kazakhs living in Siberian cities. The embassy also carried guarantees of safety for a group of 50 Kazakh traders operating in a border fort on the Esil River. Kayyp Khan and Prince Gagarin exchanged letters during this period.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1717, Kayyp Khan hosted an embassy from Fyodor Zhilin, sent by the governor of Kazan. The mission aimed to establish trade relations between the Russian Tsarist Empire and the Kazakh Khanate. The negotiations were successful, and in 1718, Zhilin returned to Russia.</p>
                <p>Documents have also been found indicating diplomatic correspondence between the Kazakh Khanate and the Ottoman Empire in the early 18th century. An archive from the Ottoman Empire contains a letter from Kayyp Khan to Sultan Ahmed III of Turkey, which is believed to have been written after 1715. In the letter, Kayyp Khan proposed creating a military alliance against Moscow.</p>

            <p>Bolat Khan was a Khan of the Kazakh Khanate from 1718 to 1729. He was the son of Tauke Khan and ruled during a period of fragmentation in the Kazakh Khanate, which split into three separate khanates: the Senior, Middle, and Junior Juzs. Due to the weakening of central authority, Bolat Khan's rule was marked by internal divisions and external threats, particularly from the Jungar Khanate.</p>
            <button class="toggle-info">More Info</button>
            <div class="khan-info">
                <p>In 1718, after the death of Kayyp Khan, Bolat Khan was elected as the new ruler of the Kazakh Khanate. However, the early 18th century saw the final disintegration of the Kazakh Khanate into three independent khanates. Some clans of the Junior and Middle Juzs chose Abulkhair as their Khan, while in Tashkent, Joldybay Khan was proclaimed the Khan of the Senior Juz, and some clans of the Middle Juz selected Sameke Khan. As a result, the Juzs pursued independent policies and often found themselves divided.</p>
                <p>Bolat Khan's reign is referred to as the "Years of Great Calamity" or "Aqtaban Shubyrindi," during which the Jungar Khaganate, under the leadership of Tsevan Rabdan, took advantage of the political fragmentation in Kazakhstan to launch invasion campaigns. In 1723, a 70,000-strong Jungar army crossed the Kara Tau Mountains and invaded southern Kazakhstan, reaching the Talas River valley. At this time, the Kazakhs were unprepared, as they were focused on migrating from their winter pastures. The Jungars slaughtered nearly all the Kazakh population in the area, forcing the survivors to flee.</p>
                <p>The Kazakh tribes retreated in different directions: the Senior Juz moved southward through Khojent, partially submitting to the invaders; the Middle Juz retreated to Samarkand and Bukhara, with some tribes moving to Saryarka; and the Junior Juz retreated to Khiva and the Volga region. In 1724-1725, the Jungars captured and looted the cities of Tashkent and Turkestan.</p>
                <p>Due to the weak central authority of the Khan, the Kazakh people organized resistance. A tribal council was held at Ordabasy near the Badam River, attended by Khans Abulkhair of the Junior Juz, Abilmambet and Sameke of the Middle Juz, and Kushik and Joldybay of the Senior Juz, along with influential Kazakh beys from all three Juzs. They agreed to unite their forces to repel the invaders. Abulkhair was elected as the commander-in-chief of the Kazakh militia. Notable Kazakh warriors such as Bukenbay, Tylak, and Sayrik played a significant role in organizing the defense.</p>
                <p>In 1728, Kazakh forces dealt a heavy defeat to the Jungars near Lake Chubar-Tengiz, along the Bulanty River. The final major battle took place in December 1729 or January 1730, near Lake Balkhash at the location of Anrakai, where the Jungars suffered another defeat, temporarily halting their advance on Kazakh lands.</p>
                <p>After Bolat Khan's death in 1729, a struggle for the Kazakh throne broke out between his son Abilmambet, Sameke Khan, and Abulkhair Khan.</p>

Ablay Khan was recognized as the leader of all three Kazakh Juz (tribal confederations), although his power was mainly centered in the Middle Juz.</p>
                <p>Ablay Khan was known for his military acumen, particularly in the wars against the Dzungar Khanate and the Qing Empire. He managed to secure Kazakhstan’s sovereignty amid the rivaling powers of the Dzungars and the Qing, maintaining his leadership through diplomacy and military strategy.
