        <h2>Traditions</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Traditions of Kazakh's culture! Here is some our traditions:</p>
        <div class="study-conspect-outer">
            <div class="content-text">
                <h1>Kazakh Traditions</h1>
                
                <h2>1. Hospitality (Қонақжайлық)</h2>
                <p>Kazakh hospitality is legendary. Guests are treated with the utmost respect, and it is considered a great honor to host visitors. Traditionally, when a guest arrives at a Kazakh home, they are offered tea and food, often accompanied by bread, jam, or a variety of dairy products like kumys (fermented mare’s milk) and shubat (fermented camel milk). The guest is typically greeted with a warm "Qonaq bolyp kelgenin'izge rahmet!" (Thank you for coming as a guest!). Kazakhs also have a tradition of providing a comfortable and welcoming environment for guests, regardless of their social status.</p>
    
                <h2>2. Wedding Traditions (Той)</h2>
                <p>Kazakh weddings are grand celebrations, often lasting for several days. They involve a series of rituals and customs:</p>

                </ul>
    
                <h2>3. Kazakh Cuisine (Қазақтың ас үйі)</h2>
                <p>Kazakh cuisine is heavily influenced by their nomadic way of life. The food is often based on meat, dairy products, and grains, which are easy to store and transport. Some traditional dishes include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Beshbarmak (Бешбармақ):</strong> A dish made of boiled meat, usually lamb or beef, served over pasta and garnished with onions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kazy (Қазы):</strong> A traditional sausage made from horse meat, often served during celebrations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Manti (Мантылар):</strong> Steamed dumplings filled with minced meat and onions, served with a yogurt-based sauce.</li>

                </ul>
    
                <h2>4. Traditional Clothing (Ұлттық киімдер)</h2>
                <p>Traditional Kazakh clothing is designed to protect against the harsh climate of the steppe. The clothing is made of animal skins, wool, and other natural materials.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shapan (Шапан):</strong> A long, loose robe often worn over the traditional attire, adorned with embroidery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kimeshek (Кімешек):</strong> A headscarf worn by women, especially married women, as a sign of modesty.</li>
                    <li><strong>Saukele (Сәукеле):</strong> A ceremonial headdress worn by the bride during her wedding, symbolizing her transition into womanhood.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h2>5. Traditional Music and Dance (Музыка және би)</h2>
                <p>Kazakh music is deeply intertwined with their traditions, reflecting the nomadic lifestyle, the vastness of the steppe, and their spiritual connection to nature. The <strong>dombra</strong>, a two-stringed instrument, is a central part of Kazakh music. Traditional dances, often accompanied by songs about love, nature, and heroism, are performed at celebrations such as weddings and festivals.</p>
    
                <h2>6. Nomadic Culture (Көшпенділік мәдениет)</h2>
                <p>The Kazakh people have a rich history of nomadism. Their traditional lifestyle revolved around herding livestock such as horses, cattle, and sheep. This lifestyle influenced many aspects of their culture, including architecture, clothing, and social structure. Traditional Kazakh homes, known as <strong>yurts (киіз үй)</strong>, are portable, round tents made from felt, which can easily be disassembled and carried from place to place.</p>
    
                <h2>7. Proverbs and Sayings (Мақал-мәтелдер)</h2>
                <p>Kazakh proverbs and sayings (maqal-matels) are an important part of their oral tradition, often offering wisdom passed down through generations. They reflect Kazakh values such as respect for elders, honesty, and the importance of family. Some popular proverbs include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Үлкенге – құрмет, кішіге – ізет" (Respect for elders, kindness to youth).</li>
                    <li>"Еңбек ер атандырады" (Labor makes a hero).</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h2>8. Religion and Spirituality (Дін және руханилық)</h2>
                <p>Kazakh spirituality traditionally centers on <strong>Tengrism</strong>, an ancient religion based on the worship of nature and the belief in a supreme deity, Tengri. Over time, Islam, particularly Sunni Islam, became the dominant religion, although elements of Tengrism can still be found in Kazakh spiritual practices, such as reverence for nature and the spirits of ancestors. The <strong>Nauryz</strong> festival, which marks the spring equinox, is one of the most important celebrations in Kazakhstan and reflects both the traditions of the nomadic past and Islamic practices.</p>
    
                <h2>9. Festivals and Holidays (Мерекелер)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nauryz (Наурыз):</strong> A major holiday celebrated on March 21st, marking the arrival of spring. Nauryz is a time for family gatherings, feasts, and outdoor activities. It symbolizes renewal, growth, and the beginning of a new year.</li>
                    <li><strong>Qurban Ait (Құрбан айт):</strong> An Islamic holiday where Muslims sacrifice an animal, usually a sheep, and share the meat with the less fortunate. It is a time for charity, family gatherings, and prayers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Republic Day (ҚР Тәуелсіздік күні):</strong> December 16th marks Kazakhstan’s independence from the Soviet Union, celebrated with national pride.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h2>10. Death and Mourning Traditions (Өлім және аза)</h2>
                <p>The Kazakh people observe mourning customs that reflect their respect for the deceased. When a person passes away, the family holds a <strong>"zharatu"</strong> (funeral) ceremony, and a memorial service is often held on the 40th and 100th days after the death. The Kazakh mourning tradition emphasizes respect for the soul of the departed, and relatives may refrain from joyous celebrations during this period.</p>

                    <h2>Kazakh Soviet Art</h2>
                    <h3>Folk and Musical Culture</h3>
                    <p>In 1922, a contest of folk singers was held in Karkaralinsk, and the Petropavl Pedagogical College choir performed in Moscow. <strong>Alexander Zatayevich</strong> documented Kazakh folk songs, publishing anthologies such as <em>“1,000 Songs of the Kazakh People”</em>.</p>
    
                    <h3>National Theater and Performances</h3>
                    <p>In 1926, the first National Kazakh Theater opened in Kyzylorda under <strong>Zhumat Shanin</strong>. Notable performances included <em>“Enlik-Kebek”</em> by Mukhtar Auezov.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <h3><strong>Painting</strong></h3>
                    <p>A significant contribution to the portrayal of the life and customs of the Kazakh people was made by Russian artists of the progressive movement. Artists who were part of various expeditions in Kazakhstan, such as B. Smirnov, O. Fedorchenko, and P. Kosharov, reflected the lives of the people in their works. The theme of Kazakhstan and Central Asia was especially significant in the works of the famous Russian artist V. Vereshchagin. In his painting "The Surrounding Mountains of Lepsinsk," he skillfully conveys the beauty of the Kazakh land. The artist N. Khlyudov dedicated all his works to Kazakh themes, preserving more than 100 of his paintings, watercolors, and sketches. With great love, he depicted the Kazakh Steppe in his paintings "Herding Livestock" and "For Firewood."</p>
                    <p>Applied arts in Kazakhstan have a centuries-old history. Products of folk artisans were showcased in major exhibitions in the 19th century in Petropavlovsk and Kokshetau (1876). Magnificent syrymak carpets, Tuskiz wall carpets, and other items were displayed. The decoration of these products used three styles of Kazakh ornamentation: geometric, plant-based, and zoomorphic. Silver and bone inlays were common in the saddles and horse equipment. Embroidery was widely used in the production of men's and women's clothing. In rural areas, wooden products made by Kazakh artisans (kebezhe, tosek agash, and sunduk) successfully competed with factory-made ones. Metal products also gained popularity, with jewelers creating exquisite jewelry. Kazakh jewelry and national costumes were exhibited at the 1868 World Exhibition in Paris, and Russian society got acquainted with Kazakh musical instruments at the 1872 exhibition in Moscow.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3><strong>Musical Art</strong></h3>
                    <p>The main motif of Kazakh classical music in the second half of the 19th century was the people's struggle for freedom against oppressors. These works reflect national character traits such as kindness, generosity, heroism, and broadness of soul.</p>

            <h2>How do new generations relate to traditions?</h2>
            <p>
                New generations often engage with traditions in both innovative and reflective ways. While some choose to preserve them as a way of honoring their heritage, others reinterpret traditional practices through modern perspectives, blending cultural elements with contemporary art, fashion, and technology. 
                For instance, younger artists and designers often revisit traditional motifs, like those in the epic *Kyz-Zhibek*, using them as inspiration to create works that resonate with a global audience while maintaining a deep connection to their roots. Additionally, traditions are kept alive through education, festivals, and storytelling, ensuring they remain a relevant part of evolving identities.
